        <p>Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer who battles the demonic forces of Hell, from a first-person perspective. The game continues its predecessor's emphasis on "push-forward" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, Chaingun, BFG 9000, Ballista, and the Unmaykr. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the "Crucible Blade" energy sword, the Sentinel Argent Hammer (Hellbreaker), and a retractable arm-blade called the "Doomblade" can also be used. The arm blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent "glory kill" executions, which drops extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the "Meat Hook", a ranged accessory that grabs onto enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a grappling hook, useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. In addition, there is the Flame Belch, a flamethrower that sets enemies on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.[1] New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.</p>
